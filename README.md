## üëã Hi, I go by Max! 
 :sparkles: Pronouns: They/Them <br/>
 ‚ö° I'm a passionate, disciplined, and determined software engineer. I recently graduated from BrainStation. My pivot into software engineering has been challenging and exhilarating, however, my bootcamp experience has equipped me with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in the fast-paced industry.  <br/>üå±  I'm currently learning UX/UI design to help bridge the gap between functionality and user experience. 
 	<br/>:computer: Currently working as a freelancing software engineer to service and share people's vision with the digital world by designing and developing applications that are not only robust and efficient but also intuitive and user-friendly.<br>
